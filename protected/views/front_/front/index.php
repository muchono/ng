						<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
						<p>Two most important things in SEO are content and backlinks. Both must be of extremely high quality - only in this case you can count on positive results in SEO. If you are deep enough in your industry, writing quality content won't be a problem for you. It's more complicated with quality links.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>What is a quality link?</h3>
						<p>This is the link that corresponds to the following criteria:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Placed on authoritative and popular website.</span></li>
							<li><span>Placed in thematically relevant content in a visible place.</span></li>
							<li><span>A site, where the link is placed, must not to be a "Link Farm".</span></li>
							<li><span>A page with placed link must be frequented.</span></li>
							<li><span>Natural looking link (no anchor).</span></li>
						</ul>

						<h3>How we do this?</h3>
						<p>We have established connections with the website owners and privileged writers who work on these sites. Often we provide popular websites ready-made posts of desired topics and with links needed to our clients.Term of writing and placing publication is different depending on popularity of a website. In average it's 5 - 7 business days.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
						<p>You <strong>pay only once</strong> per each publication. It means, that all posts with your backlinks are placed on all life time of your chosen resource. This is very beneficial for you because you don't need to pay a monthly fee for links placement as many link building companies offer. In addition, we were able to optimize our work in such a way that the majority of publications costs <strong>up to $100</strong>. Of course, publications on some authoritative sites cost much more expensive due to the difficulty of obtaining links on these websites. But remember, the more difficult to get a link on a website the more valuable it is for search engines and the more useful it is in reality.</p>
