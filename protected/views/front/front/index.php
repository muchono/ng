						<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
						<p>There're two most important things in SEO, which are content and backlinks. Both should be of extremely high quality - only in this case you can count on positive results in SEO. If you are profound enough in your industry, writing high quality content won't be a problem for you. But it is more complicated with high quality links.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>What is a high-quality link?</h3>
						<p>That is a link that addresses the following criteria:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span>It is placed on respected and popular websites;</span></li>
							<li><span>It si placed in thematically relevant content in a visible place;</span></li>
							<li><span>A website, where the link is placed, must not to be a "Link Farm";</span></li>
							<li><span>A web page with a placed link must be frequently visited;</span></li>
							<li><span>It is a natural-looking link (no anchor).</span></li>
						</ul>

							<h3>What you'll get? </h3>

							<ol>
								<li><span>Improvement of positions in the search engines;</span></li>

						<h3>How do we manage it?</h3>
						<p>We have established connections with the website owners and privileged writers who work on these websites. Usually we provide popular websites with ready-made posts of desired topics and with links required by our clients. The terms of writing and placing publication are different depending on popularity of a website. It is 5-7 business days on average. </p>
						<br>
						<h3>What about the prices?</h3>
						<p>You <strong>pay only once</strong> for each publication. It means that all posts with your backlinks are placed for the period of existence of  your chosen resource. This is very profitable for you because there is no need to pay a monthly fee for placing the links like many link building companies do. In addition, we managed to optimize our work in such a way that the majority of publications cost <strong>up to $100</strong>. Obviously, the publications on some respected websites are much more expensive due to the difficulty of obtaining links on these websites. But remember, the higher the difficulty of getting a link on a website, the more valuable it is for search engines and the more useful it is in reality.</p>
