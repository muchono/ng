(19, 'Do you make refunds?', '<p>Yes, but under certain conditions. We make refunds, if we couldn&rsquo;t place a publication you ordered because of reasons, that don&rsquo;t depend on us. We also could make a refund by client&rsquo;s request if a publication or link in it disappeared, but not later than in 365 days (1 year) after its initial placing.</p>', 0, 1),
(20, 'What is Anchor?', '<p><strong>Anchor</strong> &ndash; how it is also called Anchor Text &ndash; the word itself or expression that is a hyper link. More information about anchor text you could read <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/anchor-text">here</a>. Besides, the word &ldquo;here&rdquo; in this sentence is an anchor.</p>', 0, 1),
(21, 'What is Business Anchor?', '<p><strong>Business Anchor</strong> &ndash; it is an anchor that is simultaneously served as existing query in Google. For example: website design; buy permanent links; how to get a free site - all these expressions are examples of Business Anchors.</p>', 0, 1),
(22, 'What is Branded Anchor?', '<p><strong>Branded Anchor</strong> &ndash; these are anchors, that contain the name of your company, website, brand. For example, for website http://www.microsoft.com the brand anchors would be: Microsoft; Microsoft Company; microsoft.com; Microsoft Inc; microsoft website, etc.</p>', 0, 1),
(23, 'What is Naked Link URL?', '<p><strong>Naked Link URL</strong> &ndash; it is an expression in SEO, that is used for labeling links without any anchors. For example, the link with anchor &ldquo;http://www.microsoft.com" for website http://www.microsoft.com will be named the naked Link URL.</p>', 0, 1),
(24, 'What is Time Interval?', '<p><strong>Time Interval</strong> &ndash; is a time interval over which we begin to work on the next sponsored post for a client. I.e., if a client wants to stretch posting, for example 5 links in a month &ndash; he can order all 5 sponsored posts at once and mention in order&rsquo;s details Time Interval that is equal 4 business days. This means, that our team would begin to work on each following sponsored post with the interval that is equal 4 business days. In such a way client will receive 5 backlinks in 5 sponsored posts not in one day, but approximately regular during a month. It is accepted by search engines very well and doesn&rsquo;t arouse any suspicions.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Note:</strong> By default Time Interval is equal 1 business day. It means that every day our team will begin work on a new sponsored post.</p>', 0, 1),
(25, 'What is Nofollow Link?', '<p><strong>Nofollow Link</strong> &ndash; are the links, in which an attribute&nbsp; rel="nofollow" is written. The meaning of nofollow doesn&rsquo;t allow search engine to pass on the concrete link. It means, that&nbsp; Nofollow links would not be taken into account officially by search engines during the ranking. In fact absence of Nowollow links shows the search engines, that most likely a link profile of a given website is received not naturally. That is why presence of&nbsp; Nofollow links&nbsp; is as important as presence of common Dofollow links.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>For example</strong>,&nbsp; Nofollow Link: &lt;a href="http://examplesite.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;example site&lt;/a&gt;</p>', 0, 1),
(26, 'What is Dofollow Link?', '<p><strong>Dofollow Link</strong> &ndash; is an opposite to "nofollow". It is a common hyper link without a tag&nbsp; rel="nofollow" . It is such a&nbsp; link, that is taken into account by search engines during website&rsquo;s ranking.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>For example</strong>,&nbsp; Dofollow Link: &lt;a href="http://examplesite.com" title="Example Site"&gt;example site&lt;/a<br /><br /></p>', 0, 1),
(27, 'What is Redirect Link?', '<p><strong>Redirect Link</strong> &ndash; is a link, that uses a technology of user&rsquo;s referral to the address inside of the site and only then you could go from this page to the desired&nbsp; URL.&nbsp; It is considered, that search engines couldn&rsquo;t monitor the source of visit by such a link and don&rsquo;t take Redirect links into account during the ranking. In reality presence of&nbsp; Redirect links is useful for links&rsquo; mass variety as well as nofollow links&rsquo; presence. Search engines&nbsp; trust more that websites, which have in their links&rsquo; profile not only dofollow links, but also nofollow and redirect.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>For example</strong>,&nbsp; Redirect link: &lt;a href="http://examplesite.com/go.php?http://you_site.com/"&gt;.</p>', 0, 1),
(28, 'Will these publications be shown on front pages of these sites?', '<p>In fact, there are not so many such websites. The matter is that really popular sites rarely place last published posts on their main page. Such sites have sections on main page: Most Popular, Top Stories etc. On front page they publish only the most interesting among hundreds of recently added articles. Exceptions are sites working by blog principle, in condition that they publish on their front page latest publications. Such sites have corresponding notes in the description. If description of a website doesn''t have an indication that publication will be shown on a front page - then this site doesn''t publish recently published posts on its front page.</p>', 0, 1),
(29, 'How the prices for publications are formed?', '<p>Prices for publications&rsquo; writing and placing mainly depend on traffic and authority of a website . The publications on more attended and authority websites, with high rates of DA and Google PR, would cost more. One more important moment, that influences the price&rsquo;s forming is the complicacy of post&rsquo;s placing in each separate website. On some popular websites only privileged authors can publish the articles. That&rsquo;s why the price of publications on such sites couldn&rsquo;t be cheap. From the other hand, more difficult to receive a backlink from the website, more valuable it is for search engines.</p>', 0, 1),
(30, 'What guarantees, that the posts/backlinks are placed forever?', '<p>We watch, that our clients receive high quality service. We guarantee, that your publications will be placed for 1 year term. It doesn&rsquo;t mean, that publications and links in them will be&nbsp; &ldquo;live&rdquo; only one year. But if by any reason during 365 days (1 year) after publication&rsquo;s primary placing it is disappeared&nbsp; - we are ready to reestablish the publication for free or propose to change it to the publication of the same price value or more on another website. We could also propose to return money, that client have paid for this publication.</p>', 1, 1),
(32, 'What are the terms of one post’s writing and placing?', '<p>The terms depend on each website individually. On average that is 7 business days for one sponsored post. Sometimes the terms of placing could be up to 1 month. Such websites as Forbes and Hufingtonpost could moderate the posts longer &ndash; from 4 till 12 weeks. It depends on moderators of given website, vacations/holidays and other unplanned and force majeure situations.</p>', 1, 1),

We, from our side, guarantee the publications&rsquo; placing for the period of &nbsp;365 days (1 year) after primary placing.</p>', 0, 1),
(36, 'Is it possible to correct the existing posts?', '<p>No. Mostly it&rsquo;s not possible to correct the published posts, that&rsquo;s why when you fill in the forms, please, mention all details for your publications. After post&rsquo;s placing to make any corrections to it&rsquo;s content would be problematic .</p>', 0, 1),
(37, 'What happened if for any reason an ordered publication wouldn’t be fulfilled?', '<p>In this case we would propose you a publication for substitution on other website of the same price value or higher or we would return your money.</p>', 0, 1),
(38, 'I have ordered a publication a week (two, three...) ago. In Live Report it is still marked as  "In Work" – what happens?', '<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t worry. In some cases the terms of publications&rsquo; writing and placing could&nbsp; be greatly delayed. The reason for this could be a big queue of new posts for website you have chosen, long moderation, vacations/holidays and other unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;</p>', 0, 1),
(39, 'Could I change the chosen for publications websites after I have fulfilled and paid for the order?', '<p>No. After you have paid for the order you couldn&rsquo;t change its conditions &ndash; websites&rsquo; URLs or any other details of publications.</p>', 1, 1),
(40, 'How to choose websites for sponsored posts placing?', '<p>Choosing websites for sponsored posts writing and placing, please, first of all pay attention to such criteria as Traffic and DA. The higher these rates are, the more effective would be&nbsp; the post&rsquo;s placing on such a site. Websites&rsquo; age is one more important criteria for SEO &ndash; the older the site is, the better.</p>', 1, 1),
(41, 'What kind of profit would I receive from sponsored posts using?', '<p>The main purpose of service is an effective promotion in search engines. If you choose websites-donors for publications, anchors, links and other details correctly &ndash; your website would improve its positions in search engines, would get traffic from posts&rsquo; visits, would get more leads, etc.</p>', 0, 1),
(42, 'How often should I order publications for effective SEO?', '<p>There is no any limits for publications&rsquo; quantity. It&rsquo;s important to remember, that it&rsquo;s necessary to support a regular growth of new backlinks without abrupt appearance of multitude publications and also without abrupt stop of links&rsquo; mass regular growth on the websites. Use the option of&nbsp; Time Interval , that allows to receive necessary quantity of publications with given periodicity and not all at once.</p>', 0, 1),
(43, 'Is the publications’ buying for Google Penguin and Panda secure?', '<p>Service usage is absolutely secure for Google Penguin and Panda&nbsp; if you follow the next rules:<br />1. Mostly use brand anchors, naked Link URL and less use business anchors;<br />2. Use different links&rsquo; types: dofollow, nofollow, redirect.<br />3. Link not only on the main page of your site, but also on subpages/subdomains.</p>', 1, 1),
(44, 'How to increase the publications’ effectiveness?', '<p>Here are several advices, that allow to increase publications&rsquo; effectiveness:<br />1. Use mostly brand anchors, naked Link URL and use less business anchors.<br />2. Use different links&rsquo; types: dofollow, nofollow, redirect.<br />3. Link not only on the main page, but also on subpage.<br />4. Place new publications and links on your website regularly.<br />5. Choose more relevant websites for your publications, choose websites with maximal traffic&rsquo;s rate and DA. Use filters on our website for this.<br />6. Promote published posts in social networks, forums, blogs &ndash; all these could really increase pay-off from publications.</p>', 0, 1),
(45, 'What kind of anchors/keywords for the links is better to use?', '<p>We recommend to minimize the usage of business anchors &ndash; not more than 5% from the whole amount. Use in sponsored posts the following: naked Link URL, brand anchors and common expressions, such as: here, click here, read more, this post, more info, read this article, check this and so on.</p>', 0, 1);

(24, '10 Possible Reasons Why Your Site Is Not Indexed by Google', 'general.jpg', '<p>Nothing is more devastating for a webmaster than to realize that his/her website''s pages are not indexed on Google. This is as good as their web pages being non-existent! Integral to the success of a web based business or even a non-commercial website is the amount of organic traffic it can muster up through the best search engines (read Google).</p>\r\n<p><!-- pagebreak --></p>\r\n<p>Pre-requisite to even appearing on Google search results for your targeted keywords is being visible to Google''s web crawlers. Simply put, indexing is what Google does to find out websites that can feature in its search results. Imagine the loss it''s going to be for your web store, blog, and web portals if they cease to exist for Google!</p>\r\n<h2>How to find if your web pages are not being indexed?</h2>\r\n<p>The simplest trick is to conduct a quick Google search by typing in <em>site:yoursite.com, </em>where ''yoursite'' is replaced with the name of your website. Next, observe the number of search results it shows, and compare the number with the actual number of pages of your website. Since Google''s search results give a ballpark estimate, it''s alright if you don''t get an exact match in the numbers. However, a substantial difference is a cause for concern, and observation of the same should be followed by a thorough check. In most cases, if you see a vast difference, or if you don''t even get a result, it''s time to see why Google is not indexing your website properly.</p>\r\n<h2>What to do when Google doesn''t index your website?</h2>\r\n<p>The first step you must take, bypassing every other tip or trick given to you by any web wizard, is to check out your admin panel in Google Webmasters Tools. It is easy to spot the common problems with websites that render Google unable to crawl or index them. Of course, there could well be cases wherein everything will look perfect shape with your Google Webmasters Tools dashboard. There are several common reasons that cut websites off from Google''s indexing efforts. Here, we discuss 10 of the commonest of these reasons, and their solutions.</p>\r\n<h3>Your website is too new to be found yet!</h3>\r\n<p>New webmasters often find their websites missing from Google''s expected search results. Ideally, it makes sense to wait a day after you publish your website for it to be indexed on Google. If you still can''t find it, check whether the sitemap is correctly created and successfully submitted to the search engine. Also, you might need to request Google to fetch your website, which will involve logging into Google Webmasters Tools and following some simple steps.</p>\r\n<h3>The domain is banned by Google!</h3>\r\n<p>Google has been constantly upgrading its search algorithms, and is proactive in penalizing websites that do not abide by its principles or best practices. In most cases, a Google penalty is in the form of a decrease in the ranking of a website. However, there are cases of severe violation of Google''s webmasters guidelines that result in complete removal of a website from Google''s index! In such cases, Google sends a notification of website de-indexing to the webmaster. So, unless you''ve had a specific notification from Google, you can assume that the de-indexing is because of any of the other reasons. Also, remember to follow the best practices of website traffic building.</p>\r\n<h3>The robots.txt file is blocking the website or parts of it</h3>\r\n<p>Robots.txt file is used by website developers to mark out portions of the website that are not intended to be indexed. It can happen that a developer can block out the entire website or some unintended part of it by mistake. The simple fix is to check the robots.txt file and remove the relevant entries from it.</p>\r\n<h3>Google is failing to crawl your webpages</h3>\r\n<p>In several cases, webpages are found to be de-indexed just because Google''s crawlers are unable to crawl them. To identify such crawling errors, go to Google Webmaster Tools and find out the ''Crawl Errors'' by selecting your website and clicking on ''Crawl''. You will be shown the pages with the error, if there are any.</p>\r\n<h3>Lots of duplicate content on your website</h3>\r\n<p>In many ways, Google''s crawlers can give up attempts of crawling your website if there is too much duplication of content there. Multiple URL''s pointing to same content can force Google to give up attempting to crawl your website, or de-index it. The best solution in such a scenario is to identify the duplicate URLs and make them redirect to the parent link. Also, canonicalization of pages could serve your purpose, but it comes with the flipside that Google has been known to have de-indexed websites with confused canonicalization.</p>\r\n<h3>Hosting problems - server failure, slow download speed</h3>\r\n<p>Does your website take forever to load? If so, it''s highly likely that Google''s crawlers will not crawl your website. Also, if your hosting provider experiences frequent server downtimes, your website runs the risk of being de-indexed. Crawlers will not access what they can''t access, as simple as that. Hosting problems and slow downloading speeds can kill your website even if they manage to get crawled, so avoid these issues at all costs.</p>\r\n<h3>Troubles with settings in terms of AJAX and Javascript</h3>\r\n<p>Google can skip indexing of pages with AJAX and JavaScript. These web development languages are not too easily indexed by Google crawlers. So, if your pages are incorrectly configured in terms of AJX and JavaScript, then Google can skip the pages. So, for AJAX and Javascript intensive web-pages, be very careful about the configuration.</p>\r\n<h3>No-index meta tag used to block website</h3>\r\n<p>Webmasters, or web designers, have control over elements of their websites that they don''t want to be indexed. No-index meta tags are used for this purpose. An example of the same is &ndash;</p>\r\n<p>&lt;META NAME=&rdquo;ROBOTS&rdquo; CONTENT=&rdquo;NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW&rdquo;&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Such a line of code, if present in the home page''s code, can cause the website to be de-indexed as the crawlers consider the meta tags as a request for not indexing the website! The simple solution &ndash; remove the piece of code with the statement similar to above.</p>\r\n<h3>Site is closed for indexation in .htcaccess file</h3>\r\n<p>Simply put, the ,htaccess is a part of the way the website exists on a server, and is instrumental in making the website available for access on the global internet network. Written in Apache, the .htaccess files can be used to block crawlers, and can hence be the unintended reason of a website being ignored by Google''s bots.</p>\r\n<h3>Visibility for search engines switched off in WordPress</h3>\r\n<p>If you''re using Wordpress for publishing your web content, your website could fall into the dark nether space of non-existence if you fail to switch the privacy settings on. The path is &ndash; Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy to Check. Just ensure the simple step, it could be the difference between the indexing and ignoring of your website by Google''s crawlers.</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'This article will help you to find out why your website isn''t indexed by Google.', 'Google, indexing, SEO', '10-possible-reasons-why-your-site-is-not-indexed-by-Google', 482, '2015-10-03 16:00:21', 1, 1),
(25, 'How to get under the Google filters with a 100% guarantee?', 'general.jpg', '<p>Yep, you haven''t misheard : "How to get under the Google filters with a 100% guarantee". There are hundreds of tips and articles about how NOT to get under the Google Penguin and Google Panda, however it doesn''t enlighten most SEO marketers and that''s why we decided to describe how can you actually get your site chased by Google filters. You can be sure that those methods were tested and they work. So, if we are going to ditch a website, we are positive to use them. If not - we don''t want to be under Google filters, we act vice versa.</p>\r\n<p><!-- pagebreak --></p>\r\n<h2>1. Get a free SEO content.</h2>\r\n<p>We can start with the most practical way to easily get SEO content in couple minutes. Let''s imagine an ordinary situation, we don''t have much time to write some unique content or think it''s just lame (let those who don''t have anything important happening do it). Find in Google some sites with a similar theme, copy a text from the main page (as well as from any other pages) and place it on your personal website. Here you go!.. almost done. Just some small steps to do and you''ll get an excellent content, even better than the original. Simply stuff the stolen content with keywords that drive your site. Put keywords in different parts of the text, so that they appear everywhere.</p>\r\n<h2>2. And now the links.</h2>\r\n<p>A lot of links. Enormous amounts of links. Remember, the more links you have, the better. But having lots of links doesn''t mean having huge expenses. Here''s the secret how to really get thousands of links quickly and for pennies. Go to Digitalpoint Forum and in the buy section create a topic "Looking for tons of cool and cheap links". In couple minutes you''ll receive dozens of letters that will offer you to purchase thousands of cheap links in bulk. Moreover, I recommend you to point your email in Threads on forum and you''ll get thousands of emails with the attached Excel files from grateful Indian marketers. So buy links in large batches - a lot and straightway. Especially if your site is new, it''s better to buy thousands of links at once, thus you''ll get a lot of traffic and your site will go up in searching results. Listen to no one - the attendance and the reputation of donors is a myth. Keep to the main thing - the amount of links, because there''s almost no difference whether will or will not the site for placing a link be trusted.</p>\r\n<h2>3. But what about the anchors?</h2>\r\n<p>Anchor texts can be a very important moment for the SEO promotion of your site. Choose some relevant to your website keywords, it will be better if their amount will be up to 5, not more. Use those anchors in all your links. Don''t use unoriginal or brand links - they are useless. If we aim to promote site due to particular keywords, than those keywords are to be in the links. Another important hint - nofollow links are of no use for us, we need only dofollow links.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Relevance of the donor-sites.</h2>\r\n<p>I''ll be honest - I won''t even bother with that. It is very hard to find relevant websites, especially trustworthy. And the cost of such links will be high. That''s why don''t waste your time and money and simply buy links in bulk as I''ve already mentioned above.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Should you get permanent links?</h2>\r\n<p>Under no circumstances! It is absolutely meaningless. Permanent links will cost a lot more than those for a limited time. The money saved can be more effectively used on purchasing more links in bulk. Buy for a month or two. Afterwards, if necessary, you can prolong them. The most important, I''m repeating again, place as many links on the website as possible. Don''t let it bother you that they will disappear in some time. Google is totally okay if links disappear. It even seems more natural for him.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Sell links by yourself.</h2>\r\n<p>In order to compensate some expenses on buying links I recommend to sell links by yourself. You ask how other webmasters find out that your site is selling links? Very simply - place an ad in side wide block that you sell links on this site. Come in handy can also be registration on the links exchange and set selling links automatically.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Engage in link exchange networks.</h2>\r\n<p>Another excellent way to promote your website is to use the variety of links exchange networks. As in case of trading links it is useful to customize an automatic exchange. This will save your time.</p>\r\n<h2>8. Use thousands of web directories.</h2>\r\n<p>Web directories are still totally appropriate for SEO. The main thing is to have as much directories as possible. Order on the same forum a submit for thousands of directories. I''ve seen offers of 10k free directories for only $150-200. Don''t be afraid to use such services. The description for directories should be the same. The best is to simply to copy it from your own website. When choosing the anchor determine the most important keyword for you and use it for all directories. Be focused on what is important.</p>\r\n<h2>9. Web 2.0 Sites</h2>\r\n<p>This is a very efficient method for getting high quality links, and besides it''s absolutely free. Register in popular blog platforms. Create one page websites by using those builders. The content for this site we prepare in the same way as we did previously for our site (read point 1). Each Web 2.0 page should refer to your site and to itself as well. The more such sites you build the better.</p>\r\n<h2>10. Article Marketing</h2>\r\n<p>The old school way that is still appropriate for Google. Write one article and place it in article directories. You''ll get better results if you use automatic submission services in article directories. Thus you''ll get a lot of links in a short time. And don''t forget to place some links to your site in the article, make it 5-10 on different pages of your website. As usually, use solely business anchors.</p>\r\n<p>I hope those methods will be useful for you. I recommend to use them entirely together in order to increase the chances of your website to get under the Google filters. If you aren''t willing to suffer the Google sanctions do everything vice versa and may the force be with you!</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'Yep, you haven''t misheard : "How to get under the Google filters with a 100% guarantee?".

(26, 'How does Google Panda work? How to avoid its sanctions?', 'panda general.jpg', '<h2>Google Panda &ndash; what''s this?</h2>\r\n<p>Never heard of Google Panda? Is it an all new Google product? A mascot panda for the web giant? A secret society devising means to hack Google users'' personal details? Well, Google Panda is nothing out of these. Let''s start with the basics; Google is a search engine built upon the values of simplicity and relevance, and is dedicated to providing the best possible web content results to users in response to searches made using the search engine. What logically follows is Google''s maniac dedication towards not letting low quality content find its way to the top of its search results and that''s why it continues to revamp, reinvent and improve the algorithms it uses to filter out and present web content. Google Panda is the cute sounding yet no-nonsense and revolutionary search algorithm update affected on 24 February 2011, aimed at reducing the web ranking of low quality websites that provide worthless and copied content, are dotted with irrelevant advertisements and are not useful for readers and viewers in general. At the same time as it tries to penalize low quality and useless websites, Google Panda is also about providing better rankings to top quality websites that present well researched and original content with reports, analyses and more. However, it might not be wrong to take more than a single viewpoint on what Google Panda actually is. Here are three ways to look at it:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>An algorithm update</strong> - Purely based on the number of websites that experienced considerable changes in their original rankings after the Panda update, it''s fairly justifiable to call it an out and out algorithm update.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A temporary penalty</strong> - Despite the fact that the Panda update was severe on thousands of websites, it also allowed them to cover the lost ground by correcting the mistakes that Panda is designed to penalize, which makes Panda a temporary penalty doled out on defaulting websites</li>\r\n<li><strong>An all new ranking factor</strong> - A website''s Panda Score is instrumental in deciding as to where its web pages are ranked, and this makes Panda stand in the light of ranking factors such as PageRank and Meta Tags.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Google''s Panda update is meant to target web pages that are low in quality, although they might not be spam. Before Panda did the clean up act, it was a common strategy for webmasters to publish several low quality articles that were mindlessly stuffed with keywords, to content farms. In fact, webmasters used to submit these low quality articles to several content farms to increase their backlinks, at the cost of Google''s search results'' quality and worth. Panda went after thin content and made sure that such useless websites with very little originality were penalized. The Panda penalty is site-wide and affects the entire website if enough web pages are deemed useless by Panda. Also, Panda made sure that websites that just copied their content from other websites were not able to outrank the original creators of the content. No wonders it was launched with the name of Farmer, because of its clean up jobs on content farms!</p>\r\n<h2>How does Google Panda work?</h2>\r\n<p>Of course, there will never be 100 percent information available in the public domain about the intricacies of how Google Panda works, there is still enough known to satiate inquisitive webmasters. Panda is an algorithm based on heuristics that doesn''t depend on too many complex calculations and instead tries to categorize websites into categories such as ''low quality'' and ''high quality'' after allotting their web pages a score known as the Panda Score. Now, this score depends on several quality attributes with their different weights, and this selection of these attributes with their weights is what Google''s engineers would have done after diligent analyses and studies of hundreds or thousands of websites. So, once a website''s web pages are allotted Panda scores, the cumulative impact on the website could be a decrease or increase in its ranking. Since the selections of quality attributes and their weights in order to calculate the Panda Score are always improving, we have already seen several updates to the Panda algorithm and can expect the same from the future as well.</p>\r\n<p>In more practical terms, Google Panda''s working is best understood in terms of identifying the website aspects it evaluates. Among the most integral of these are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Originality of content</strong>- Websites that copy content from multiple sources and pack their web pages with what seems like really worthwhile content are at the receiving end with Panda, and that''s because of the prime importance of original content. Content duplication is severely dealt with by Panda, whereas original content with reports, tables and analyses is rewarded.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Substantiality of content </strong>&ndash; Panda does not go well with websites that have many web pages but not much content on the pages. Websites with just a few lines of mediocre content on their pages end up in the bad books of Panda and are penalized.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Worth of content</strong> &ndash; How does Panda successfully make out worthwhile content from merely copywriter quality content? It uses parameters such as author authority and website''s credibility to adjudge upon the same, and ensures that informative and worthwhile content laden web pages get better Panda scores.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Apart from all these, there are other deficiencies that Google Panda identifies and penalizes. Web pages with loads of advertisements creating a chaos and the ones with thoughtless and reckless designing are not really appreciated by Panda. Also, web pages that are not updated for long times are penalized, as are websites that index useless pages on Google.</p>\r\n<h2>Which errors on a website will cause to sanctions of Google Panda?</h2>\r\n<p>Good, bad, evil or cute - Google Panda is here to say, and considering indications from Google, it''s going to be a vital cog in Google''s search engine experience improvement drive for the future. So, nothing is more important than identifying as to what invites the fury of Google Panda for webmasters. It''s after diligent analyses of websites that have gone down after Panda updates and the possible content and quality deficiencies they suffered from that a suggestive list of aspects that can be serious reasons of Panda sanctions has come up. Here''s more on all that does not go well with Panda.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thin content</strong> &ndash; You''ve heard it before, but it makes all the sense to hear it again. Among Panda''s most obvious victims are websites that have loads of web pages but not much content on them. Such websites often inflate themselves with advertisement pages and thin content pages, which leave users wanting for more. Google wants its users to be served only really useful web results, and that''s why it chases away thin content websites.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Compromised content to chase keywords</strong> &ndash; How irritating is it for you to surf a website that is laden with web pages links that seem useful, but only serve the same content over and over, with minor keyword variations. This irritates Panda no ends! Webmasters often compromise website quality to be able to target keywords with minor variations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Duplication is a sin</strong> &ndash; Content duplication is a certain turn down for Google Panda. Whether you copy content from your own web pages to other pages, or copy anybody''s content to use on your website, Panda will be tough on your website. Even if you''re providing multiple pages with remarkably similar content in the form of printer-friendly, single-page (instead of multi-page article), or stripped down pages targeting mobile devices, Panda will identify and correspondingly penalize you, unless you no-index these similar content pages. Dynamically generated URLs pointing to the same source URL need to be accompanied by Rel=''Canonocal'' tag for Google to not treat them as deliberate attempts to duplicate pages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ad laden websites</strong> &ndash; Panda has cracked down on websites that serve a lot of advertisements to users. In fact, among the prominent traffic losers after Panda updates are websites that make readers scroll down through rivers of advertisements before serving them any useful content. <strong>Even irrelevant and excessive banner ads are deemed to be hindering to a decent user experience, and are hence penalized by Panda. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Empty web pages and redundant URLs</strong> &ndash; Whether it''s a housekeeping mistake on the part of webmasters or a deliberate attempt to fool viewers into believing that the website is content rich and expansive, URL duplication and empty web pages are a strict NO NO with Google Panda. Even if empty web pages result from the internal search functionality of the website, Panda slaps penalties.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Purchased links instead of earned links</strong> &ndash; No longer are the rich webmasters able to buy link-backs in order to secure better SERPs with Google. Panda is smart enough to identify backlinks from shady sources, and is quick in penalizing the websites that are identified for using black hat and cheap link buying techniques.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Housekeeping mistakes that make your websites suffer </strong>&ndash; Google Panda update has always been tough on websites that suffer from deliberate or unintentional housekeeping errors that make the users experience a messy one. Among the most obvious lessons for webmasters are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Panda assumes that your websites are either hosting spam or not doing anything to prevent spam when it finds a considerable proportion of irrelevant outgoing links on your web pages.</li>\r\n<li>Unless you use robots.txt to point out that search results are not meant to be indexed, Google treats the same as an attempt to duplicate content and hence levies appropriate penalties on your website''s Panda Score.</li>\r\n<li>Improper internal linking makes your website suffer, so avoid multiple links pointing to the same pages, whether intentional or not.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Image cortesy <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/dnvillanueva/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dn Villanueva</a></span></p>', '', '', '', 0, 'Google Panda – what’s this?

(28, 'Negative SEO - 10 Things You Might Not Know About', 'general.jpg', '<p>Ever since the Penguin algorithm began penalizing websites that appeared to have built unnatural backlinks, webmasters and SEO experts have been breathing with difficulty whenever negative SEO is mentioned. In a world where the hue and cry over Penguin''s penalties and manual penalties is yet to die down, negative SEO has all the ingredients of being the next big explosion. What is negative SEO? How is it done? How simple is it for somebody to do negative SEO for an unsuspecting competitor''s website, causing to be thrown off Google''s SERPs? How to safeguard your website if an evil negative SEO campaign targets you? What is Google''s stance on the same? The answers to these questions are not easy to find. Here are 10 things you''d not have known about negative SEO:</p>\r\n<h2>1. It''s not just about deliberately planted crappy backlinks!</h2>\r\n<p>SEO consultants, black hat enthusiasts, and webmasters - all define negative SEO differently, but essentially mean the same thing. Whereas some consider malicious efforts to bring down your website by building spam links or stealing the most valuable links from your website as negative SEO, others also like to include issues such as brand impersonation, fake news and false stories, negative PR, and even hacking into the scope. Considering what the intention behind the activity is, all or some of these activities can fall under the dark umbrella of negative SEO.</p>\r\n<p>Right from creating spam links to your website in black listed forums to creating full-fledged fake websites to particularly hurt your web reputation, anything done to make your website''s visibility, traffic, and reputation suffer is negative SEO. Invariably, major search engine search algorithm updates are followed with an increase in negative SEO buzz, as evil, desperate, and dishonest webmasters and SEO masterminds try hard to exploit the loopholes of the updated algorithm. It''s noteworthy how negative SEO news has started popping around</p>\r\n<h2>2. Pulling competition down is just ONE reason to indulge in negative SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Whereas every naive webmasters first fears about negative SEO are mostly about his/her website being linked back to by hundreds of low quality links from discredited forums, it''s important to realize that there are other reasons too. Heard of online reputation management? Heard of SERP Bubbling? How about some positive uses of negative SEO? Here''s more-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In stiff, neck to neck competitions between two or more credible website in a segment, a webmaster could take the bait of trying out negative SEO, which is all about investing in SEO for your own site, as well as negative SEO for the competing website. Like we mentioned, this involves everything from spam link building, fake news stories, etc. This is what''s technically referred to as SERP Bubbling (we''re guessing it''s a metaphor for popping a competitor out of the SERP).</li>\r\n<li>Negative SEO could be the problem and the solution at the same time. If a competitor has spread some derogatory and fake stories about your brand, you could have to consider targeting the websites running the fake stories. To do this, you''d have the option of hiring Negative SEO experts who can quickly bury the defaulting websites low down search engine results pages, effectively wiping them out from popping up when somebody tries to Google for your brand. Celebrities (who often even find themselves in need of silencing down true stories), politicians, businessmen, social figures of repute - anybody could feel the need of well-planned and reactive negative SEO to maintain one''s reputation. In fact, online reputation management services do include SERM, that''s Search Engine Reputation Management, as a part of their service mix.</li>\r\n<li>Targeted negative SEO (TNS) is a potent weapon used by social activist groups to target companies, government departments, and people in general whom they stand against. What''s noteworthy is that such targeted negative SEO attacks are not through low quality back linking, but by strong news and PR campaigns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>3. There are almost a dozen identified methods of eliminating web pages, not all are negative SEO</h2>\r\n<p>These are several ways in which a website''s presence, or ranking on a search engine can be affected by somebody other than the person who''s in charge of the webpage.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Requesting moderators and site admins to remove derogatory threads and posts</strong> &ndash; If somebody has created a page or post to tarnish your brand''s reputation, you could choose to contact the parent website''s webmaster and request for removal of the content, and possibly even banning the original poster.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Google insulation</strong> &ndash; Negative press stories floating about your brand? Why not pump more effort into SEO for some positive stories, so that the negative stories get choked under the pile of links carrying positive news? In this manner, the detrimental links are insulated off. Companies can even do this to push off competitor brands.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Google Bowling</strong> &ndash; The act of trying to bring a website down from Google''s SERPs by building thousands of spam backlinks to the website is known as Google Bowling. Planting such spam links on black listed forums, link farms, article directories etc. within a short time duration can, theoretically speaking, lead to penalization to the targeted website. Another way is to identify dynamic URLs on the target website, with slightly varying URLs pointing to the same page. Then, hundreds of variants of such URLs are created and planted online, triggering a black hat alert in Google''s algorithm which can severely damage the target website''s ranking.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Virus, code infections, and XSS flaws</strong> - SERPs ideally try to keep off infected website, which motivates negative SEO masterminds to attempt infecting your website with virus. Injecting malicious code into the website, or misusing cross site scripting to create URL''s that link to pages displaying on-page content via posted query strings &ndash; all are possible hacks to make a website suffer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Other malicious techniques</strong> - Tattling, the act of informing Google that a website is violating its guidelines, involves deliberately purchasing backlinks for the target website, and indulging in other grey hat activities without any knowledge of the target, followed by reporting of the same. False copyright and data theft claims to tarnish a website''s image also come under tattling. Another way is to create a website named very similarly to the target website, and even using same hosting and domain registrar. Then, the copy website is splattered with spam content, and 301 redirects pointing to the target website are installed. This adversely affects the target website, as the actual spam website is treated as a proxy of the target website!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>4. The socially empowered negative SEO &ndash; an increasing threat</h2>\r\n<p>An extension of Google Bowling explained above, this is a technique wherein the perpetrators create dozens of social network accounts (primarily Facebook and Twitter). Then, these accounts are used to create spam links that link back to the target website, marked with phrases like ''warez'', ''porn'', ''teens'', ''Viagra'', ''no prescription'', ''casino'', etc. As Google SERPs also include social networking site results, this technique is proving to be a lesser known and powerful trick being used by webmasters to affect competitor website rankings.</p>\r\n<h2>5. You can fight it in so many ways!</h2>\r\n<p>Though Google sticks its head out and claims that it''s close to impossible for anybody to negatively affect a competitor''s website, there are enough enticements for adventurous webmasters to test out various negative SEO roads. Thankfully, there are as many ways to be careful, proactive, and reactive to any negative SEO attempts -</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ensure your correct email ID is provided in webmasters tools, and make it a point to regularly check your webmasters account to identify anything fishy in terms of unnatural backlinks emerging.</li>\r\n<li>Stuck by a virus? It could be negative SEO evil mind trying to pull your website down. Get things right at the earliest, very hour matters. Invest in strong website security measures to prevent any such situations.</li>\r\n<li>Disavow spam links the moment you have anything to suspect, whether they are coming from social media comments or strange sounding foreign forums.</li>\r\n<li>In case of a DDOS attack, get in touch with the web host and ISP as they can control the situation quickly.</li>\r\n<li>If you can find the source of the negative SEO attempts, send in an offensive letter threatening to sue, and reporting for blacklisting to Google.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>6. From the horse''s mouth &ndash; what does Google have to say on it?</h2>\r\n<p>If you would have read through all guidelines pages on Google''s webmasters portal, you''d have read Google''s claim that there is nothing that a competitor can do to hurt your website''s ranking or have it pulled off from the index. However, post January 2003, Google mended the wording by adding an ''almost'' in between. The statement now reads - There''s <em>almost</em> nothing... Not that this is an out and out warning from Google about how you could fall for negative SEO, but it''s more about accepting that issues like a person hacking in to your website, etc. could cause changes to your ranking. Nevertheless, as the cyber-sphere went more abuzz about negative SEO, Matt Cutts quoted, in 2007, that dumping thousands of backlinks to a website to hurt its ranking is not impossible, although too difficult. Ever since Google Penguin started penalizing websites with unnatural backlinks in April 2012, the buzz about negative SEO has heightened. The launch of Google Disavow tool, which can be used by webmasters to mask out the effects of backlinks that they suspect might be from discredit websites. Matt Cutts, and some other senior software engineers have, time and again, given away valuable notes about Google''s stance on the negative SEO debate. Here are the key takeaways -</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Preventing any damage to websites because of competitors piling unnatural backlinks at them is something that Google takes seriously.</li>\r\n<li>The algorithm is smart enough to make out links that would have been placed by the webmaster, or any unscrupulous competitor, and also conducts pattern analyses in the same direction.</li>\r\n<li>Though a few unnatural looking backlinks might not matter much, but Google suggests using the Disavow tool to diffuse any such links.</li>\r\n<li>Any instances where a webmaster feels that he''s being victimized by negative SEO, the case can be reported to webmaster forums or by directly contacting John Mueller.</li>\r\n<li>Many times, what''s perceived as negative SEO, is not actually so!

(29, 'How to Create an Effective Content Marketing Strategy', 'general.jpg', '<p>If you''ve had any experience with content marketing strategies, you''ll obviously know that it isn''t just something businesses are doing to stick with the trends; it has become a critical marketing requirement. Web marketing research journals have documented and detailed that a vast majority of B2B marketers have, and need, a content marketing strategy, as that''s the way forward to sustainable web presence.</p>\r\n<p>So if you''re looking for ways to improve your existing strategy or want to create your first successful content marketing strategy, this is the right place to start. But before that, it''s vital to remember that a content marketing strategy is not same as a content strategy, although these terms are used interchangeably nowadays, especially since the parameters that define them are rather blurred. So, let''s clarify the difference before we move on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For a content marketing strategy, marketers devise and create a clear picture of what an organization does, and why the do it. It is focused more on creating inventive ways in which you can engage your audience by using content to boost profitability.</li>\r\n<li>A content strategy, on the other hand, is a much deeper and broader term that encompasses the creation, distribution, and regulation of usable content. Experts have established that a content strategy helps you manage your content, as an independent business asset.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Basics</h2>\r\n<p>Now that we''ve clearly defined what a content marketing strategy covers, let''s discuss some of the fundamentals of a content marketing plan. Even if you''ve handled content marketing earlier, keeping these points in mind will either act as a refresher or teach you things that you haven''t implemented before. So, always ensure that you map out the following components in your marketing plan:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Goals and Objectives</h3>\r\n<p>As always, you need to establish the purpose of developing a content marketing plan. This starts at the grass-root level as you even need to figure out things like why you want to produce content and draft a marketing plan for it. They say that knowing if half the battle, and planning is the other half. SO, if you now your ultimate goal even before you begin your planning, you''ll have a much easier time determining the best course of action for your content marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p>If yours is a new business, avoid producing content just because you think it will add to your profits because you probably won''t be using content effectively. And no business wants to waste time and resources on something that isn''t going to deliver any useful results. But, if you''ve been in business for some time, review your previous content marketing plans, and their subsequent outcomes. Check what you can do differently this time around by setting new goals, and making sure that your team''s goals are aligned with the rest of your organization''s goals.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Target Audience</h3>\r\n<p>You don''t want to go around marketing sports cars to senior citizens or hip replacement surgery to minors. If you really want your plan to hit it off, you need to define your content''s target audience, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;buyer''s persona.&rdquo; This is especially critical to businesses that are just starting out and are new to content marketing. By gauging your target audience, you will enable yourself to produce relevant and valuable content that they''ll want see. And even if you''re an experienced marketer, you might have changed your target market or shifted clients. So, if you have to target a new group of people or expand your current market, it''s always best to keep reviewing your audiences'' parameters audience on an annual basis.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Types of Content</h3>\r\n<p>Most individuals typically start off with blogs, but if you''re looking to venture out and try creating other content sources, think of the ones you want to activate.

A content marketing strategy is intangible compared to search engine marketing, which is exactly why you have to think about the strategic role that content marketing plays in your organization and its ecosystem. Without a content marketing strategy, you risk making the most gruesome mistakes of content marketing, which is focusing too much on the content and overlooking the aim of your overall content strategy. Surprisingly, this blurry-eyed perspective of content marketing occurs often and can lead you to a focus on the wrong things.</p>\r\n<p>To give your strategy that edge over the others, consider these additional important factors:</p>\r\n<h3>1. Focus on Your Strength</h3>\r\n<p>What content are you going to include while creating content marketing program and how you''ll set yourself apart are important things to consider. Visitors can find the internet soaked in content, irrespective of their interest, and they''re not going to waste their time reading all of it. So, are you going to be disproportionately useful, will you create utility, will you provide motivational, inspirational, or encouraging content or otherwise? Make sure that you focus on what your target audience reads, map it back to your strengths and create a connection that attracts more visitors, so that you can add some heart and soul to your content program? Always dream to be bigger and better with your content.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Review Your Content Marketing</h3>\r\n<p>Your overall goals will ultimately dictate the metrics that you use. If you''re looking to generate awareness, measure it. And i f you want to track consumer behavior, you must do something that can be traced back to its source.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Research Your Audiences Needs</h3>\r\n<p>Your goals also dictate your audiences because you are not your own audience . Use buyer personas to populate your content marketing audience. Find out what your audience needs to learn from you. Make use of social media, involve yourself with customers and your own personnel to get a better understanding of the information you have regarding the persuasive requirements of your clients. D on''t just settle for raw data, it might get you more confused than you already are. Instead, get real customer insights through customer conversations.</p>\r\n<h3>6. Content Execution Plan</h3>\r\n<p>Use you buyer''s persona and customer conversations to establish your optimal content model. Understand how and where audience is most likely to assimilate information. Understand that different customers for the same product or service will still require different types of content. Devise a plan that showcases the content that you''ll be creating on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. And always remember to define calls-to-action. There''s no point of any of this if you''re not going make your customers do more than just read your content.</p>\r\n<p>Another harsh dose of reality is that it simply isn''t enough to create the right kind of readable content, it needs to be amplified. You basically need to market your marketing! This is where social media can be a real boon. Make a note of the places and people that can help you amplify your content marketing, including customers, employees, and influencers.</p>\r\n<h2>Enhance Your Strategy</h2>\r\n<p>So, what really makes turns a good content marketing strategy into a great one? Here are a few cautionary steps that you can take in order to get your content to the next level:</p>\r\n<h3>Step 1: Leadership</h3>\r\n<p>As bread-and-butter as it might sound, you probably have a vision as executive in a company, and it is most likely that this vision is shared with others within your organization. To share this vision, you''re going to need the right kind of people, who will create your vision and allow it to manifest. The same process applies to your content marketing strategy. If you want your team to create a killer content marketing strategy, you have to have a vision that you can effectively communicate to all the members of your content marketing team. So, keep your head clear and in the game and create a detailed content marketing strategy because your team needs to know exactly what you want from them.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 2: Who and What</h3>\r\n<p>Before you go around marketing your great content to an audience that doesn''t even get the message, you''ll need to identify your target audience and market to get your content noticed. You''ll need to know who finds what interesting, before you can even try selling it to them. So, provide some valuable content, instead of just focusing on building your brand''s image. You have to know who you''re marketing to before you decide on the kind of content you''re going to create and offer.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 3: Face the Music</h3>\r\n<p>Very few people in this world can take criticism and turn it into their biggest asset, and being honest with yourself can be quite the challenge. In order to make your content marketing strategy a success, you need to face the harsh facts. So, even if you think you''ve created a masterpiece of content, it my might seem as useful as a pile of rocks to your audience.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 4: Do the Hedgehog!</h3>\r\n<p>The management version of the ancient Greek parable, this three-circled, one focus concept allows your business to focus on three major areas that culminate into one major focus. According to the Hedgehog Concept, a business is most likely to succeed if they focus on one main goal. And in your case, your vision or goals are of the content marketing realm. It''s always best to focus on one thing than to go in multiple directions at the same time.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 5: Be consistent and disciplined</h3>\r\n<p>If there''s one thing that everyone in this world universally appreciates, its consistency. So, if you want to achieve your content marketing goals, make sure you as consistent as possible. You also need to draft a schedule that can support a consistent content marketing strategy. Even if you have millions of great content ideas already in the pipeline and ready to go, you''re still going to need to publish valuable content for your target market.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 6: Use Technology Accelerators</h3>\r\n<p>Since giving your audience a heads up about your content is the next major step in your content marketing strategy, you need to make use of the appropriate marketing tools, to help you promote your content and get it seen by millions. Not only will your content get seen, but you can also use tools to accelerate the growth of content that is published.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 7: Flywheel Concept</h3>\r\n<p>The Flywheel Concept represents what is similar to a snowball effect, which is, rolling down a snow-covered mountain and getting bigger as it gathers more snow. It might start out small, but eventually get bigger and gains momentum as it goes along. This concept can easily be applied to your content marketing strategy. The more outreach, creation, editing, publishing and social media posting you do for your content marketing plan, the higher are your chances of getting bigger and better results in the long run.</p>\r\n<h2>Important Marketing Dates</h2>\r\n<p>Once you''ve incorporated all the collective knowledge if this article into your content marketing strategy, just know that the job''s not just done yet. After you''ve developed your load if great ideas, they''re going to have to be slotted into various dates and events in an editorial calendar. Most of your ideas can be used at any point of time, irrespective of them being used in this season or the next year. That being said, you shouldn''t ignore the fact that some of your best ideas will be time-based and their effectiveness will deteriorate over time. Although such ideas probably won''t constitute the bulk of your calendar of events, they will definitely help you get those much desired traffic spikes.</p>\r\n<p>Most businesses rely on incorporating major public holidays like New Year''s, Thanksgiving and Christmas into their marketing plans. The reality is that you don''t have to limit yourself to these important dates, and you can focus on any kind of event that people might find celebration-worthy. Always include other popular holidays and dates into your content marketing strategy. You can even base your content on themes or products on these special days.</p>\r\n<h2>How Often Should You Review Your Content Marketing Strategy?</h2>\r\n<p>While some crucial parts of your content strategy (goals and objectives included) should be consistent, irrespective of how your content marketing program grows and evolves, you can routinely review and update your strategy to keep up with the changing times. In fact, some aspects of your strategy are so fundamental to your business that you probably want to them tattooed to your hand so that you don''t forget the main theme or aim of your content.</p>\r\n<p>However, you can feel free to alter other non-essential aspects of your content marketing strategy, which will most likely benefit from being periodically reviewed, measured and updated. To make sure that your content marketing program is always aligned to the changing ways in which you can reach your target, consider reviewing other aspects of plan like your channel strategy, foundation topics, and department processes, on an annual basis or as often as you feel the need to.</p>\r\n<h2>Do You Share Your Strategy With Other Departments?</h2>\r\n<p>The last question you need to ask yourself is who else will you be sharing your content management strategy with, or whether you''ll be sharing it at all. It is always beneficial to keep everyone involved by giving them organizational access to your content marketing strategy, even if they might not be directly involved in your content marketing process. As inconsequential as this might seem, it is a particularly critical aspect in larger organizations. This helps company big-wigs and your many employees, all on the same page. It also allows you minimize duplication of efforts so that you don''t end up wasting limited time and precious resources. Ultimately, it ensures that everyone is working towards a common content goal.</p>\r\n<p>Sharing your well-documented and presumably confidential strategy is also a good idea for businesses that have just commenced their content marketing. It is also useful to content teams that rely on internal or external subject matter experts (SMEs), or for organizations who outsource all or any part of their content creation and distribution process. How you communicate your strategy within your business depends entirely on the structure and working culture of your organization. It may sometimes be appropriate to share every detail and every page of documentation with your entire organization. But in other cases, you might need to exercise caution by creating audience-targeted presentation for particular stakeholders, especially if your content marketing strategy will impact their specific roles and objectives differently.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, considering how to use the principles of content marketing to push content marketing and what people actual care to know about will help you determine the components of strategy that you need to share and how to share it with them.</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'If you’ve had any experience with content marketing strategies, you’ll obviously know that it isn’t just something businesses are doing to stick with the trends; it has become a critical marketing requirement.

The tag H1 itself is the most important from all six. It displays a summary of a entire page and contains keywords relevant to a content of a page. Here example of using title H1:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">&lt;h1&gt;H1 - what is it and how to use it correctly for SEO?&lt;/h1&gt;</span></p>\r\n<h2>Why are tags h1 - h6 so important?</h2>\r\n<p>First of all because search engines, Google in particular, take into consideration h1, h2, h3 etc. in website''s indexation.

(31, 'Step-by-Step Guide to Fighting Against Content Theft', 'general.jpg', '<p>The problem with the easy availability of online content, including music, videos, text and images, is just that: not only is it accessible to potential viewers or customers, it''s easy for other websites to steal and simply copy-paste onto their own website. Just think of the mindboggling statistics: Google gets requests from at least forty million users to take down some related website which had apparently infringed on their intellectual property (content). While such content thieves apparently never suffer from the moral obligations of crediting sources, there are certain ways in which you may secure retribution for such crimes. And as always, the internet is your friend in just this.</p>\r\n<h2>Step 1. Identifying the website that has stolen your content</h2>\r\n<p>Does this seem obvious? It might well be, but you''d be surprised at how many websites don''t bother to properly check off this point correctly. What''s the right way to go about when it comes to identifying stolen content? Simple.Finding exact correspondences. Please remember that to get Google to play nice and remove those listings which reap the benefits of your work, it is first necessary to ensure you have enough evidence to back up your claims. It''s not enough to have a gut feeling that the content has been copied from your website, it isn''t even enough to have ONE phrase that matches &ndash; after all, there''s hardly anything new under the sun that hasn''t already been used by thousands of writers. No matter which tool you use to check the authenticity of your claims (remember, a vague gut feeling that &ldquo;this website''s content seems to be a lot like mine!&rdquo; should always, ALWAYS be checked first).</p>\r\n<h3>Adding Calls to Action and Internal Links might help in this Process:</h3>\r\n<p>How to identify such websites? It might be easier than you think, but again it depends on (a) the provisions on your website or blog, and (b) the stupidity of the thief. For instance, if you provide a lot of calls to action and internal links with whatever content you have, you might be able to trace back traffic from a different source other than your own blog or website. This is dependent upon direct lifting off of your website''s content, and most content thieves have evolved beyond that. Still, this is worth a shot.</p>\r\n<h2>Step 2. Checking Claims with the help of the right tools</h2>\r\n<p>Tracking content that has been simply lifted off your website is quite easy, actually. All you need is a Copy Scape account or a similar plagiarism checker. If you want a free option, SmallSEOTools is a good option: but remember that free tools can only take you so far, and you might regret not using Copy Scape''s superior engine and matching abilities.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fire up the plagiarism tool of choice.</li>\r\n<li>Paste the copied content from your content bandit''s site onto the interface provided there.</li>\r\n<li>Look for the "Check for Plagiarism" or some similar option on the page.</li>\r\n<li>Wait while the engine finishes generating a report.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>With this report in hand, you should now be ready for step 3 of the process.</p>\r\n<center><img title="" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/01/02.jpg" alt="" /></center>\r\n<h2>Step 3: The Pacifist Movement right here, right now</h2>\r\n<p>You have the information, you have the legal backing. If at this point you feel seething anger and a lot of pent up frustration, we would hardly blame you. However, what might be somewhat helpful at this stage would be to reach out to the website''s owners. You may be surprised to find that some of these websites didn''t even directly copy your content: they may have actually paid somebody in good faith, and their crime would be to have not verified the content before actually putting it up on their website. You may even get them to offer you compensation for lost business, and make them take off the content altogether &ndash; that is, if you''re feeling lenient. Of course, this is a rather rosy picture of the world so if the attempt at dialogue fails, it might just be best to skip on to the next step.</p>\r\n<center><img title="" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/01/03.jpg" alt="" /></center>\r\n<h2>Step 4. Reporting it to the highest authority, i.e. Google</h2>\r\n<p>You can''t just waltz into a local police station and say &ldquo;Help, my content has been stolen!&rdquo; can you now? What you can do successfully however is to contact Google, just to mitigate the damages already done to your website. When you have substantial evidence that content is being pilfered from your site and used almost verbatim in another one, and as long as you can establish that you were there first, Google is generally quite helpful.</p>\r\n<h3>How do you report content?</h3>\r\n<p>To report duplicate content, all you need to do is log in to your google account. The google webmaster account allows you to report on a variety of situations to Google, including &ldquo;Webspam&rdquo; that is defined by Google as something that tries to trick Google into providing it with a higher ranking than it would otherwise get. Phishing, Copy right or legal issues, objectionable content, are just some of the many options which Google lets you report on. You can simply use this link to reach <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/dmca-notice?hl=en&amp;pid=0" target="_blank">Google''s copy right removal page</a>.</p>\r\n<center><img title="" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/01/04.jpg" alt="" /></center>\r\n<h2>Step 5: Time to reach out to external sources</h2>\r\n<p>Let''s assume that there are advertisements on the website that has stolen most of its content from you. While advertisers would generally pay good money to have link backs to their site, most have a strict policy on illegal content or legal right infringements. Chances are that if you reach out to these sources of funding for the website, and present them with enough information to support your claims, you''ll be able to shut down the business of this external website altogether. By ensuring that their funding dies out, you would leave them with only a skeletal frame &ndash; and hopefully by this time Google will have stepped in as well to help you out here.</p>\r\n<p>Another crucial step is to run a check on their hosting option, and if they''re based in the US, you might be able to run a check by means of WHOis.net. It''s basically a domain registry and lookup website which features a search engine type of interface. Look up this content bandit''s website and find out who the internet service provider is. They may also be able to help you out and step in by stopping the errant website.</p>\r\n<center><img title="" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/01/05.jpg" alt="" /></center>\r\n<h2>Step 6: The Final Take Down</h2>\r\n<p>The final step is to send a cease-and-desist to the website that is illegally copying your content from you, and this doesn''t have to be as hard a process as you might think. For instance, you can create a take-down notice with the help of any of the assistive websites such as Copybyte who can send notices on your behalf, and Plagiarism Today that has templates for such notices to minimize any hassles to you.

(32, 'The ''Everything'' Guide to Understanding the Link Between Social Signals, SEO and Website Rankings', 'general.jpg', '<p>It''s easy to allow oneself to be swamped and hence overwhelmed by information while trying to expand knowledge about good SEO practices. Mostly, not all of the information will be in agreement, and inherent contradictions will weigh you down all the more. Thankfully, there are enough credible sources of SEO guidance out there in the wide open web, which are fairly credible and can be used as a base to develop one''s long term SEO strategy. Before we take you deep into the bare realities of the hot topic of social signals'' contribution to SEO success, let''s invest a couple of minutes in understanding as to what the generally agreeable opinion about the most important SEO ranking factors is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Content</strong> - Yes, it''s still the king, and the trend of improvement in search engine algorithm indicates that we''ll never grow out of the habit of uttering the clicked statement!</li>\r\n<li><strong>Technological make-up</strong> - Pages that are optimized for quick loading with robust website architecture, presence of good meta tags and optimized internal linking are increasingly being rewarded by the search engines that matter.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Backlinks</strong> - They were always important, just that there''s a lot of fine tuning happening all the time, allowing search algorithms to treat credible and valuable backlinks as the real substance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>User experience</strong> - A perfect example of correlation; websites with high click through rates, appreciable on-site time and low bounce rates are also the ones that rank high!</li>\r\n<li><strong>Social signals</strong> &ndash; The immense correlation between the number of Facebook shares, number of Twitter retweets, and Google +1s received by URLs with the ranking they show on search engines is still obvious.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now that we''re in the thick of things, let''s give a definition to the term, which also answers the question &ndash; ''what are social signals?''</p>\r\n<p>Well, social signals are visible recommendations that indicate towards the worthiness of a URL. The visibility is on the form of counts of all the different mediums of approval that social media networks use. From the most popular Facebook Like to the more elusive Twitter retweet, from a well-meaning share on Facebook to a +1 vote on Google+, there are so many ways your website can send out a signal of being socially credible and likeable. What''s more, you can even see the option of giving a +1 to a URL when you see it featuring in the top search results on Google. That''s a fair indication to make SEO enthusiasts believe that there is, after all, a link between social signals and website rankings. Now is a good time to discuss how good social signals can help your website''s rankings.</p>\r\n<h2>How do social signals actually improve your website''s ranking?</h2>\r\n<p>Without delving deep into the question of whether social signals distinctly improve a website''s ranking for the moment, let''s try to find out how social signals could, theoretically, contribute to increased rankings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A powerful channel of creating new inbound links</strong> - The momentousness of inbound links for your website''s ranking can hardly be undermined. With a strong social presence, you will be easily found, and will be easily linked to. The credible social impressions created by strong social signals motivate webmasters to include your website''s link on their web networks.</p>\r\n<p>With a rapidly growing base of Facebook and Twitter followers, your website will always be in with a shot at sudden traffic increases, especially when you post a ground-breaking post every now and then. Your chances of being talked about on blogs and being mentioned in comments and posts on popular websites become really huge in such cases, and ranking impetus follows.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Less bounce rates, more on-page times, and repeat traffics</strong> &ndash; the triple impact of a strong social presence is among the most coveted outcomes of a good social signals strategy. These attributes are important for ranking well with Google and other search engines, and your social personality and brand following will land you in good stead with these.</p>\r\n<p>Action points to help you enhance social signals for your website:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The virtues of timing are surprisingly underestimated, despite the tremendous social marketing relevance they have. Save yourself the effort of analysing peak traffic hours at Facebook, and adopt the following post timing strategy.</li>\r\n<li>On a weekday basis, you''d be well off targeting Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday to share your content. If you are loaded in terms of content, take things a step further and send out posts at 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, and 6 PM, Eastern Standard Time.</li>\r\n<li>Enhance the social engagement quotient of your social posts by adding an image with text, as visuals are the most trusted design elements to capture attention.</li>\r\n<li>Wording your post in the form of a question is another proven effective technique of giving your social posts a better chance of being liked and shared.</li>\r\n<li>Studies about the kind of content finding the maximum social appeal suggest that top lists, DIYs How To guides are the real attention getters in the social digital world.</li>\r\n<li>Among the other successful social engagement strategies are competitions that reward participants and winners, posts with a voting option, and posts with titles that rivet the attention of readers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The answer from the horse''s mouth &ndash; Is the social signals buzz real?</h2>\r\n<p>Filtering out all the chaff, here are some distinct takeaways from Matt''s message to webmasters -</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-family: courier new; font-size: large;">At present, Google does NOT use social signals to adjust the ranking of a website.</span></p>\r\n<p>Whereas many bloggers and SEO experts claim that social signals result in website ranking increase, it''s actually mere correlation, and not causation. Simply put, it is because a website is actually great, engaging and worth following that Facebook and Twitter users share it on their social profiles, and it is this ''awesomeness'' that''s causing the raking improvement, not the fact that the website finds several followers on Twitter or Facebook. Social signals are, hence, an indirect benefit of a website publishing some great content.</p>\r\n<p>There are some real difficulties that dissuade Google from crawling social networking pages.</p>\r\n<p>In the course of the video, Matt remarked about some concrete issues that prevent Google from considering and evaluating social signals.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Matt Cutts declared Google''s crawlers had realized that they were restricted from crawling the web pages of a popular social network, which obviously means that social networks can, any day, restrict Google''s crawlers permanently. This is a massive roadblock preventing Google from investing man-hours in working out a complex crawling algorithm for social networks, as there''s the real and documented risk of it all going in vain.</li>\r\n<li>Because of the dynamic nature of social network web data and the instantaneous nature of the data collection activities of Google web crawlers clashing with each other, making algorithms work faithfully with social signals is a real challenge. The number of Facebook shares, the authority of the people who share the content, the number of retweets, and the demographics of the people who trigger these social signals &ndash; all these are immensely dynamic attributes, and make the task of an intelligent algorithm that creates the right digital impressions out of the information unimaginably complicated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>A sneak peak at the future in terms of social signals</h2>\r\n<p>Matt Cuts hinted significantly towards the future of WWW with less anonymity, and that is in sync with all the buzz about Google Authorship. Increasingly, web searches done for bloggers and writers are showcasing all the content crated by the author, and not just the content that''s live on highly ranking websites. With a lot of fine tuning and reinventing of algorithms, understanding ''identity'' will be seemingly possible for crawlers, and Google Authorship will be at the core of the revolution. So, 10 years down the line, social signals could well be a distinct part of Goggle evaluation and ranking criteria, provided that digital identities become recognizable by crawlers.</p>\r\n<h2>Closing thoughts &ndash; the long and short of social signals</h2>\r\n<p>Now that you know the crux of social signals and whether or not they are worth investing time, money and effort in for increased rankings, here''s the gist of it all. Whereas social signals, in all likelihood, are not currently considered important by Google, yet there continue to be some really useful indirect outcomes from your efforts going towards increasing your website''s popularity through Facebook, Twitter and Google+. With more shares and tweets, you can expect really substantial increase in traffic counts, along with the enhancement of your digital branding. Scaling your website and web network becomes an exciting and empowered strategy with a strong social presence. Converting your social signals into customers is another grand opportunity for you to move into ecommerce. So, in essence, social signals are powerful enough to get you the outcomes that Google ranking improvement will send your way, that''s increased web traffic!</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'It’s easy to allow oneself to be swamped and hence overwhelmed by information while trying to expand knowledge about good SEO practices.

At the time you''re uploading the video, you''re also required to make it accessible under any one of 3 different accessibility styles &ndash; Private, Public and Unlisted.

Not in this case, as it is sure shot and straightaway success that we want. You''ll need to upload the video as Unlisted.

See the screen below; you''ll need to fill in details just as instructed in the screen.</p>\r\n<p><img src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/02/07.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Here is a salient walkthrough the screen:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Title</strong> &ndash; Fill in the title in format ''How to &lt;exact keyword&gt;''.

Hit Enter and watch the video play.</p>\r\n<h2>Creating the virtual viral impression</h2>\r\n<p><strong>9.</strong> We''re now about to impress upon YouTube that your video is on the verge of being viral, and that''s by boosting the video with lots of free likes and views. Yes; it''s all going to be free, and really quick. To begin with this, you''ll need to install Google Chrome, if you''re already not using the superb browser. Check out <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html#eula" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a> to download Chrome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10.</strong> Set Chrome up, and then install a wonderful little extension or Chrome, called Auto Refresh Plus. Help yourself to the following <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh-plus/oilipfekkmncanaajkapbpancpelijih?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>\r\n<p>It''s a free extension, and you will need to click on the ''Free'' button.

Yes, you can close down the refreshing tab, and can use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/my_videos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> to directly jump on to the Video Manager, where we''re going to take the action now. Ensure that you do just as shown in the images that follow.</p>\r\n<p>Select the check box to the left of the newly added video''s thumbnail.</p>\r\n<p><img src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/02/12.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>Click on the Action option; the drop down shows options such as Public, Private, Unlisted. Click on the Public button, and let changes get automatically saved after that.</p>\r\n<p><img src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/02/13.jpg" alt="" /></p>\r\n<p>All the efforts we''ve done on the past few minutes are supposed to impress upon YouTube that your video has made itself viral, courtesy the whopping likes and views it has gathered at the time of being public.

(34, 'How to Recover from a Google Penguin Penalty – the 2 Most Effective Techniques', 'general.jpg', '<p>Google''s proactive approach towards ensuring that its users enjoy by far the best web experience with the search engine has never been more comprehensively established than with the two fascinatingly named and amazingly managed algorithms - Panda and Penguin. Among these, Google Penguin is dedicated towards penalizing websites that breach the code laid down by Google''s Webmaster Guidelines. First implemented in April 2012, Penguin is Google''s answer to webmasters using ''black hat'' SEO tactics to establish backlinks supremacy. Whether it''s about webmasters cloaking keywords to leverage low quality and unmonitored blogs for leaving backlinks, exchanging links with other webmasters, buying links, creating large number of thin websites to link back to the main domain &ndash; Google Penguin is coded to be severe on all such websites, and reducing their rankings.</p>\r\n<p>Google Penguin analyzes websites'' backlink profiles, and if it deems that a large number of backlinks to the website come from irrelevant, low quality, or shady sources, then it levies a ranking penalty on the defaulting website. Penguin takes a lot of factors into consideration, each contributing towards identification of trustworthy, worthwhile, authoritative and valuable websites as well as the ones lacking on these aspects, so that the latter can be appropriately penalized. At its heart of hearts, Google Penguin is about dissuading webmasters from indulging in back hat SEO tactics for backlinks, creating useless networks of websites that clog the web, and using closely matched anchor text links to lead readers towards irrelevant content, so that the web browsing experience of a user can be fulfilling.</p>\r\n<h2>How to understand that your website has received Google Penguin Penalty</h2>\r\n<p>It shall help you to engrave in your mind that Google Penguin intends to find and penalize all websites have several link-backs unrelated with the quality of the website. Realizing that a Penguin penalty has been levied on your website is the pre-requisite to be being able to make amends and regain your lost rankings.</p>\r\n<p>Smart webmasters should be vigilant about certain changes to their website''s rankings that are indicative of a Penguin penalty having struck. Among these are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Massive fall in rankings for a keyword, or a group of similar keywords - Use any link profile analysis tool to identify whether keyword specific penalty or ranking drop has befallen on your website. For instance, if your website''s rank, for keyword ''old cars for resale New York'' has plummeted from 13 to 350 odd, you have reasons to believe that Penguin has penalized you. <br /><br /> <img title="google penguin penalty" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/03/01.jpg" alt="google penguin penalty" /></li>\r\n<li>Pages containing a particular keyword being de-indexed from Google, but the remaining pages being intact</li>\r\n<li>If a manual penalty has been meted out, you might find a message in your Google Webmasters Tools profile, under Manual Actions option<br /><br /> <img title="manual penalty" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/03/02.jpg" alt="manual penalty" /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unintended pages show up in search results instead of the main pages, for specific keywords that have led to the penalty</p>\r\n<h2>How to recover a website from manual penalty because of unnatural incoming links</h2>\r\n<p>Your GWT inbox is where the manual penalty information will come like a kiss of death to catch you unawares. There are two basic types of manual action notices that you could receive:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Site-wide manual penalty</strong> - This notice tells you the reason behind your entire website being penalized</li>\r\n<li><strong>Partial manual penalty</strong> - If specific parts of your website are penalized, this notice will explain the reasons and the extent of the penalty</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Let''s jump straight on the recovery boat. The recovery exercise is best understood by breaking the efforts and tactics into successive steps:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>1. Take your time, it''s the smart move</strong> - Of the few webmasters that are really geared up for recovering their website''s ranking, only counted ones are smart enough to realize that quick cures are just not meant for recovering from manual penalties. It''s in your interests to not jump into sending a reconsideration request to Google and use ample time to ensure that your recovery efforts are substantial enough to lead to results. Be prepared to slog it out for a few weeks before submitting reconsideration request.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2. Begin a comprehensive link audit</strong>- This is the core of the recovery process, before you begin with the manual link removal and Disavow actions. Whereas manual link removal refers to asking webmasters to remove links pointing to your websites from their domain, Disavow is a Google tool that you can use to point out to Google the backlinks that you have no control over and want excluded from being considered for assessing your website. A word of caution &ndash; Disavow is best used only when efforts of manual removal are exhausted. Use Google Webmasters or any other reliable link profile analysis tool to identify the kinds of backlinks connecting to your website. Depending upon the category the links fall in, you''ll need to do one of these:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Let them be, if you''re sure that they come from great quality websites and are not what would have caused the manual penalty. Also, social media links are something you''d like to keep, as they''re mostly nofollow.</li>\r\n<li>Plan to disavow them straightaway without any manual removal effort. Such a course of action would be valid for or links from pages that can''t be found, are offline, or are from websites with spam TLDs such as .ru domains linking back to an English website, spam websites that are exact copies of other websites, and domains with PageRank 0 unless they''re related to your website and new on the web. Prepare a proper list of all such links.</li>\r\n<li>Request removal, for links that come from websites that are themselves penalized manually or algorithmically, blogs hosting closely matched anchor texts for manipulative link building to your website, and multiple websites that are part of a link network.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>3. Set up a Google Drive account to trace your clean up job</strong> - It''s best that you create a Google drive spreadsheet with tabs such as Source URL, Destination URL, email/contact of webmaster of source website, dates of first, second and third requests for removal of your website''s link, and the status of the link (removed/still live). By meticulously recording, monitoring and fine tuning your efforts, you''ll be able to get the best possible results. Write a well-worded request for manual link removal to webmasters, and follow up twice. It''s only after you exhaust your sincere efforts of manual removal of unnatural links that you should add links that still end up being live after this step to the list of links for Disavowing that you prepared in step 2.</li>\r\n<li><strong>4. Use the Disavow tool</strong> - Head over to your Google Webmaster Tools account and use the Disavow tool. Select your domain and provide the file containing all the links that you want disavowed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>5. Send reconsideration request</strong> - Remember, your sincere efforts towards cleaning up unnatural links could come to a zero if the reconsideration letter is not well-worded. Realize that you''re message will be read by humans and not machines, so be as detailed as possible in terms of explaining what could have caused the problem, all that you''ve done to rectify the same, and that you''d never let it happen again in the future. After sending the reconsideration request, be patient and wait for Google''s response. Also, never forget that as and when the manual penalty is revoked, you will be under stricter monitoring than other websites, so be ultra cautious and proactive about ensuring that there are no unnatural links pointing to your website.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To round things up, here are some interesting facts about manual penalties from Google:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>More than 400,000 manual actions are initiated by Google every month.</li>\r\n<li>In parallel, 20,000 reconsideration requests submitted by webmasters are also processed.</li>\r\n<li>Most of the websites that receive manual penalty don''t even attempt recovery.</li>\r\n<li>On an average, webmasters can expect to hear from Google on their reconsideration requests in a period of 30 days or less.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now that you''re aware of the way out after being hit by a manual penalty, let''s try to see how algorithmic penalties are dealt with.</p>\r\n<h2>How to recover a website from algorithmic penalty because of unnatural incoming links</h2>\r\n<p>A quick note on how manual and algorithmic penalty (Penguin) differ - Whereas both manual link penalty and Penguin algorithm deal with unnatural links, the real difference is really in the sense that manual penalties are decided upon and levied by a human, whereas Penguin is purely a code that runs on your website and automatically works a penalty, if it''s needed. Manual penalties are, obviously, one site at a time and could well result from a complaint made against your website by another, whereas the algorithm would scan websites ''attributes, compare them to what it considers correct, and then takes appropriate action. The big question &ndash; what does a webmaster have to benefit from by appreciating the differences between manual and algorithmic penalties? Also, how is an algorithmic penalty supposed to be tackled?</p>\r\n<p>A Penguin algorithm penalty cuts deep across the way your website gets its backlinks, whereas the manual penalty, since it''s human generated, could well be mapped closely to a particular deficiency of your website. So, it''s as much about recovery as about prevention and preparation when it comes to safeguarding from algorithmic penalty. If you believe that a Penguin algorithm update has caused a dip in your website''s rankings for specific keywords or otherwise, understand that your analyses and clean up will have to be very wide scoped and large scaled, as there will not be any specific leads on the kinds of backlinks causing the action, as is the case with manual penalties. Of course, this also means that a reconsideration request will not be of use, as nobody from the Google antispam team will evaluate your website. Moreover, the timeframes involved in recovering from an algorithmic update will be large, because Google needs to reassess your website via the same algorithm when it runs again, and needs to revaluate the signals that the algorithm considers important for deciding on or against a penalty. This underscores that trivial and specific improvements might not be enough to recover from Penguin; your efforts will need to cut across the entire spectrum of natural backlinks and quality attributes coded into the Penguin algorithm.</p>\r\n<p>So, do everything you did in steps 2 to 4 in recovering from a manual penalty at a large scale and to the breadths and depths of your website, so that it''s in good shape when Penguin comes visiting again.</p>\r\n<h2>What do you have to do for your website to not receive Google Penguin Penalty</h2>\r\n<p>Has Penguin come, flapped, and gone, leaving your website no better or worse off than you were prior to the algorithm''s visit? Before you forget everything else in congratulating yourself, warm up to the fact that Penguin will be back sooner than you expect (the Penguin 3.0 version is slated for roll out anytime close to the end of 2014). So, bracing yourself up to keeping your website Penguin-proof is as smart as anything you can do for the sustenance and success of your website. Add to everything the fact that you might yet not be aware of all that Google Penguin likes and dislikes, despite surviving its clean up job. We round up this guide by surfacing out some sure shot tactics to help you remain immune from Penguin''s fury, whenever it revisits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be very stingy with your guest posting</strong> &ndash; Several reasons make guest posting a mediocre link building strategy. Google can easily detect guest blog posts and comments that link back to your website. Moreover, guest blogging is what novices and incorrigible webmasters are doing to create backlinks, irrespective of that fact the Penguin has cracked down on such websites. Only indulge in guest posting when it''s relevant and worthwhile.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start thinking the LDR way</strong> &ndash; By the way, LDR is Linking Domain Relevancy, a factor that defines the relevance of the domain hosting a linkback to your website. Authority signals like Page Rank are being supplanted by LDR signals, which necessitates that you establish backlinks on credible and relevant domains, so much so that such high LDR links form the integral part of your backlinks profile.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Get anchor text diversity strategy in place</strong> &ndash; Penguin is always severe on websites that use exact match or very similar anchor texts for backlinks. Statistical analyses of websites and their anchor text variations show that Penguin survivors have almost 80% anchor texts unique, which is whopping. A rough outline would be to target 50% unique anchors, and the rest fairly equally spread over texts such as website''s URL, webmaster''s name, niche, etc. Just remember that anchor texts must not be too similar!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Build a branded website</strong> &ndash; Of course, we''re not asking you to spend a million odd in brand building, but stressing upon the fact that Google does give preferential treatment to branded websites, which could stand you in good stead as the next version of Penguin rolls out. Work out detailed and comprehensive social media strategies to muster up Facebook and Google+ following, get a logo and a 1-800 number, and try to do what other branded websites are doing!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be proactive with bad links clean up</strong> &ndash; Before Penguin takes matters in its own hands, it''s better to clean out your bad links by analyzing your website''s backlinks profile using a link analysis tool and then ensuring that backlinks from shade and un-trusted sources are removed. Also, use your time to ensure that the backlink profile boasts of a good spread of types of backlinks, such as from guest posts, article directories, press releases, etc.</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'Google''s proactive approach towards ensuring that its users enjoy by far the best web experience with the search engine has never been more comprehensively established than with the two fascinatingly named and amazingly managed algorithms - Panda and Peng', 'Google Penguin Penalty, Google Penguin, Google Panda, Google Webmasters Tools, manual penalty, Disavow Tool, Google Drive', 'how-to-recover-from-a-google-penguin-penalty', 703, '2015-12-11 20:42:32', 1, 1);

(35, 'Why You Shouldn''t Buy SEO Packages Guaranteeing The Fastest Growth Of Positions In Search Engines', 'general.jpg', '<p>I wanted to write this article a long time ago but somehow did not have enough time. So, I decided to sort it out and to explain how it works and why you should not do it. There is a great forum - BlackHatWorld Forum. BHW really a cool forum where you can pick up lots of useful information about search promotion of websites and on-line marketing. Also this forum has a popular section where the forum members sell their SEO services. It''s such a bright show that reminds me the carnival in Rio de Janeiro . Flashy colorful banners, announcements of all colors of a rainbow shout to a user that here he can buy unbelievably efficient backlinks, which are 100% Manually, 100% Safe for Google Panda and Penguin, 100% guaranteed result etc.</p>\r\n<p><img title="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/04/01.jpg" alt="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" width="684" height="770" /></p>\r\n<p><img title="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/04/02.jpg" alt="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" width="684" height="459" /></p>\r\n<p>The majority of such offers sell back l inks in packages &ndash; from several dozens of links up to thousands of links per purchase. But you don''t know on what exactly websites these links will be placed. You cannot control quality and even uniqueness of the content of where they will be placed. You are not able to verify whether these sites are located on different IP and have individual NS servers. No dynamics at all &ndash; you don''t influence frequency of emergence of new links. In other words, you buy pig in a poke &ndash; having absolutely no idea what you are going to achieve as a result. Most probably your site will be penalized by Google Penguin for using fake spam links. Now I am going to give you the reasons why.</p>\r\n<p><img title="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" src="http://www.netgeron.com/images/blog/04/03.jpg" alt="Why you shouldn''t buy SEO packages guaranteeing the fastest growth of positions in search engines" width="684" height="849" /></p>\r\n<p>Since 2013 Google has taken an extremely hard stand in relation to websites that use spam links in order to manipulate search results. For this purpose Google has issued two filters - Google Panda and Google Penguin. The algorithm of operation of these two filters still remains a puzzle but in broad terms we have an idea as to what and how these filters react.</p>\r\n<p>Following are the main factors signaling to Google that a site conducts foul play and that sanctions have to be imposed on it. First there is a description of the factor and below &ndash; what most SEO packages offer and not only those that are present on the Blackhatworld Forum. Let''s begin with the most significant factors:</p>\r\n<h2>1. Usage of business anchors for backlinks.</h2>\r\n<p>The majority of the websites having the prevailing number of links with business inquiries as anchors fall under the sanctions of Google Penguin.</p>\r\n<h3>How to avoid it?</h3>\r\n<p>To reduce to a minimum the usage of business anchors. It is better to use links without anchors (URL only), brand anchors or phrases like &lsquo;this'', &lsquo;here'', &lsquo;click here'', &lsquo;more info'' and so on. Anchors of the links should be as more diverse and trustworthy as possible.</p>\r\n<h3>What do the sellers of SEO packages offer?</h3>\r\n<p>In majority of cases the sellers of SEO packages allow to use any anchors but their quantity is often limited to 5 - 10 types of anchors.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Exclusive usage of dofollow backlinks.</h2>\r\n<p>It is a common error because of which a tremendous number of websites have suffered due to Google Penguin.</p>\r\n<p>When buying or getting backlinks, many webmasters tend to use just dofollow backlinks which are the ones that influence the growth in search results. They say that nofollow links have no value for Google. Matt Cutts himself has once declared that Google does not account for nofollow links when rating websites. But if we take a backlink list of any popular website that has natural links, we will see that a significant part of these backlinks will be nofollow, because people naturally share links on their blogs, forums, social networks and often these links are nofollow by default. Thus, we come to a conclusion that presence of just dofollow backlinks means for Google that a website has got them unnaturally.</p>\r\n<h3>How to fix this problem?</h3>\r\n<p>To use nofollow backlinks alongside with dofollow backlinks.</p>\r\n<h3>What do the sellers of SEO packages offer?</h3>\r\n<p>Most SEO packages sell &lsquo;100% Do-Follow links'' as the most efficient ones for SEO.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Backlinks are placed on crappy websites.</h2>\r\n<p>When it is about hundreds and thousands of backlinks purchased in one go, the quality of websites where these backlinks are placed is usually very poor. Frequently such websites are created with the purpose to place links on them. Google has perfectly learned how to identify such sites and to analyze to what projects they are linked. Links from such websites almost guarantee sanctions by Google Penguin.</p>\r\n<h3>What''s the cure?</h3>\r\n<p>Your site should have high-quality and useful content which other visitors will want to share, therefore building links to your website. It is recommended to buy backlinks exclusively in popular websites.</p>\r\n<h3>What do the sellers of SEO packages offer?</h3>\r\n<p>Hundreds of crappy links from link farms . As a rule, all sites belong to the SEO service owner and he is capable to create several hundreds of backlinks for your website very quickly. Despite a seeming completion of work, these links are harmful and often lead of a ban of the website. Imagine that a SEO package promising 250 &lsquo;of superior quality, SEO friendly links, safe for Google Panda and Penguin'' have been bought by 200 people. Google will detect the pattern very quickly when it notices that 200 independent sites have backlinks from identical domain names.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, nearly all websites where links are placed have low traffic, are stuffed with copy-paste links <br /> and often have uniform content. All this brings to a sad end &ndash; both for clients of a SEO service and for an owner of a network of websites selling SEO package. But the last has got his ROI long ago and is going to create as many websites, will invent a new super-efficient and definitely &lsquo;100% safe'' SEO service.</p>\r\n<h2>4. The text around the link is not unique.</h2>\r\n<p>That is to say &ndash; many backlinks to your website are inserted in one and the same content. This happens when they save money on writing a singular and ultimate content or when the owner of a website who has ordered the service has no clue how exactly the link building for his website will occur. This unfortunate link building ends up exactly like all previous cases - Google identifies the regularity without effort &ndash; equal content &ndash; and inflicts sanctions for spam links.</p>\r\n<h3>How to escape the trap?</h3>\r\n<p>Every natural link to your site which people have willingly created will always vary in content. The content may be scarce or abundant or none &ndash; but it will practically never be identical. That''s why , if you buy backlinks, they should be placed on webpages with authentic text around the links.</p>\r\n<h3>What do the sellers of SEO packages offer?</h3>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">''$6 for 20 comments with the link!''</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #339966;">''$99 for writing a unique press-release and placement of it on 30 popular websites! ''</span></h2>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">''Platinum Package 400 High PR Links $499 Per Month!''</span></h2>\r\n<p>Sounds good, doesn''t it? But what''s the reality?</p>\r\n<p><strong>In first case</strong> one comment with a link to your website is been written and is been placed on 20 mostly trashy blogs with an automatic moderation of comments. Or even worse - all 20 blogs belong to one common network of sites. In any case the content used is not original and any uniqueness is out of question.</p>\r\n<p><strong>In second case</strong> the seller of a SEO package is honest with clients &ndash; he writes one press-release about your goods or service and submits it to umpteenth number of websites.</p>\r\n<p><strong>In third case</strong> you expect rocketing of your site rating because you became a happy customer of the Platinum Package! Ballyhoo promises, high-sounding service title and a bombastic result. But it is not the top 10 search results &ndash; it is nulling of all positions due to Google Penguin sanctions. If a SEO package seller accepts a monthly fee for placing backlinks, he has possibility to submit and to cancel them as necessary. In most cases it is a network of websites owned by him. Unlikely all websites of this network will have individual IP''s and will be located on 400 different web hostings and their domain names will be registered on 400 separate owners (Google is a domain logger and can easily analyze data about owners even if they are hidden on WHOIS). But even if we dream it up - Google is too clever and sooner or later will discover websites that have 400 backlinks from coinciding websites. The result will be standard.</p>\r\n<h2>5. Links appear very promptly and disappear equally promptly.</h2>\r\n<p>Let''s assume you have a new website or not new but it has very few backlinks. After you have ordered Powerful SEO package Super Power Effect (oh, how I fucking love those names &ndash; specifically thought up for stupid idiots &ndash; they make me laugh), for your website they have submitted 300 links during a month or even worse &ndash; a week. Before your site was getting no more than 10 links a month and now - the whole load of 300. It is a clear evidence for Google that the links are fake. Another popular trick &ndash; you forgot to pay the monthly fee for backlinks or the SEO package owner fell ill, died, decided to quit with this business, whatever &ndash; the key is that your links have suddenly vanished in the air. The situation is extremely dangerous. This is one more reason not to buy SEO package of any sort, regardless their big names and their great promises.</p>\r\n<h3>What to do?</h3>\r\n<p>To only buy by the piece or in bulk but after a time interval. Only buy permanent links &ndash; avoid any website networks for monthly fees.</p>\r\n<h3>What do the sellers of SEO packages offer?</h3>\r\n<p>In most cases they submit many links during a short period of time.</p>\r\n<p>You should understand that all SEO services of mass production, that are not tailor-made but are made up to one and the same template with the involvement of site groups on stock, are doomed to a failure. Please consider it when purchasing backlinks.</p>\r\n<p>Should you have your own thoughts on the topic &ndash; you can share your experience in comments to this post.

(36, '15 Myths About Modern SEO', 'general.jpg', '<p>SEO for an average person is a closed branch of marketing. It is closed mainly because of the understanding - there''s no clear understanding how it works and what is necessary for SEO to be really efficient. This is primarily due to the fact that information about the search systems'' algorithms is a taboo. We, marketers, can only guess about how search systems work by analyzing the reaction of search engines on our actions (SEO manipulations) in relation to particular websites. Such empiric method of cognition the work of search engines created a lot of sustained myths about SEO that are, in fact, false. In this article, I will describe 15 most prevalent myths about modern SEO with a short disproof for each. So here they are.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Backlinks are vital for SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Only one of the possible tools. No doubt, backlinks are necessary, but in-page optimization, work with content, usability, and social networks are not less important factors.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Backlinks are of no use anymore</h2>\r\n<p>The value of backlinks is still important for the successful promotion. But now Google pays more attention to the high-quality backlinks and low-quality links became less meaningful than they used to be. Moreover, if link profile of the website has many low-quality backlinks, it can easily fall under the Google Penguin sanctions.</p>\r\n<h2>3. If you are not engaged in purchasing links, you''re safe from Google Penguin</h2>\r\n<p>There''s absolutely no guarantee that your site will not be affected by Google filters. The fact that you''re not posting artificial links does not guarantee that your site will have a high-quality link profile.</p>\r\n<h2>4. The amount of content on the page is not important - the quality of the content is far more important</h2>\r\n<p>The quality of the content is indisputably important but also is the amount. The more unique and good-quality content is on the page, the more plausible will the page be for Google. Nevertheless, it is necessary to point that a huge amount of content, especially graphic and video material, can significantly overwhelm the size of the page that will influence its download speed.</p>\r\n<h2>5. The speed of downloading the page depends only on hosting provider.</h2>\r\n<p>It is known that Google lowers in the list of search results the websites that have a low download speed. Unskillfully designed and poorly optimized website can be the main reasons for a slow download. Before you change the hosting - make sure that your website is free from such problems</p>\r\n<h2>6. Nofollow links influence SERP to the same extent as Dofollow</h2>\r\n<p>At this time, Nofollow links are not indexed by Google and not included in search results, unlike Dofollow links. Numerous experiments have shown that the Nofollow links do not have a direct influence on the increase of sites in the SERP.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Nofollow links are useless for SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Nofollow links are a constant attribute of a natural link profile of any trusted website. Its absence is the first signal for Google that this website may be placing artificial and false links.</p>\r\n<h2>8. The idea of modern SEO narrows to creating high-quality content</h2>\r\n<p>Even the most exciting and excellent-quality content will be useless if your website is attended by no one. Availability of decent content is an obligatory condition for a successful SEO, but not the only.</p>\r\n<h2>9. Reaching the TOP positions in search engines is the main goal for SEO!</h2>\r\n<p>To reach is not enough - it is necessary to hold the achieved positions. What is the point to promote a website into TOP 5 in competitive requests and afterward, for instance in few weeks, to fall down in several pages in SERP? Experienced SEO managers know how to hold the reached positions for a long time.</p>\r\n<h2>10. It is possible to determine the terms for website''s promotion.</h2>\r\n<p>Modern SEO is a rather difficult to forecast process for evaluation the precise terms of its promotion. Some SEO companies use this trick to attract clients, but it is simply a deceit. There''re no terms or any guarantees that website will actually reach the positions that the marketers count on.</p>\r\n<h2>11. It is possible to guarantee the promotion to the TOP positions in search results.</h2>\r\n<p>Not even a single SEO specialist can guarantee the TOP position in search results, simply because it is not their property and, therefore, there''s no direct influence on the websites management.</p>\r\n<h2>12. Google always detects any manipulations on SEO websites.</h2>\r\n<p>Actually, it is not so. Google and other search engines definitely track the attempts of marketers to influence the websites ratings, but in reality, they notice only the roughest signs of manipulations. If SEO is conducted by professionals - the likelihood that Google or any other search engine will notice their work with the website is reduced to a minimum.</p>\r\n<h2>13. Page Rank is an important index for SEO</h2>\r\n<p>Earlier - yes. Nowadays PR is no longer a parameter that changes website ranking in the search results. Besides this, there''re no Page Rank updates anymore and they are not expected in the future.</p>\r\n<h2>14. TOP is possible only by in-page optimization</h2>\r\n<p>Possible. But under the condition that these will be low-frequency searches that are rarely entered by users of search engines. In all other cases, the presence of a good link profile is a prerequisite for sites that usually occupy the top positions in the search results.</p>\r\n<h2>15. SEO is dead or just about to die</h2>\r\n<p>This myth is popular for several recent years when Google implemented its Penguin. While some people think so, many SEO marketers successfully promote projects in the search engines and earn decent money for themselves and for their clients. Who, by the way, also do not know that "SEO is already dead". SEO has simply become somewhat different - more subtle and not as patterned as before. Many webmasters, including practicing SEO marketers no matter how strange it might sound, were not ready for this - that''s why the myth consequently emerged.</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'SEO for an average person is a closed branch of marketing.

(37, 'How To Optimize robots.txt For Better SEO?', 'general.jpg', '<p>The robots exclusion protocol, aka robots.txt file is a simple text file created by webmasters in order to provide instructions to search engine robots on how they should crawl and index a website and its web pages. What this basically means is that a robots.txt file effectively works as an anti-sitemap, instructing search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc., what kind of content you want them to discover and index. A robots.txt file tells search engines about the specific pages on your site that you don''t want them and users to find or access.</p>\r\n<p>The problem with robots.txt files is that they are almost always neglected by webmasters during the process of search engine optimization, which means that they are usually created at the last minute, proving to be ineffective or even counter-productive. The absence of a robots.txt file wouldn''t really prevent search engines from identifying and subsequently indexing your website or specific pages, but there is a real-time need to ban search engines bots from crawling and indexing a website or section thereof.</p>\r\n<p>Another point to note is that if a robots.txt file has been is configured incorrectly, search engines will completely ignore your website''s existence on the internet! The whole point of optimizing a robots.txt file should be to make it more easily accessible, as misconfiguring it will most likely lead to bots blocking access to core components of your website. Here''s a comprehensive guide that will help you optimize your robots.txt file for better search engine optimization.</p>\r\n<h2>But wait, do I really need to use robots.txt?</h2>\r\n<p>While the absence of a robots.txt file wouldn''t really prevent search engines from identifying and subsequently indexing your website or specific pages therein, there is a routine need to ban search engines bots from crawling and indexing a particular part or section of your site. Another point to note is that if a robots.txt file has been is configured incorrectly, search engines will completely ignore your website''s existence on the internet! Though you should optimize robots.txt but you should never misconfigure it so that it shouldn''t block bots to access important part of your blog.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, the lack of a robots.txt file in your website would mean that it is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not optimized for search engine crawlability</li>\r\n<li>Susceptible to SEO errors</li>\r\n<li>Vulnerable in terms of access to sensitive data</li>\r\n<li>Prone to constant hacks</li>\r\n<li>Not as good as the competition</li>\r\n<li>Prone to indexation issues</li>\r\n<li>Most likely confusing search engines</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 1: Create or identify an existing Robots.Txt File</h3>\r\n<p>Before you do anything, it''s best to determine whether your site has an existing robots.txt file or not. If you don''t do this, you run the risk of overriding any data or configuration settings that might already been in place. The Robots.txt file, if any, can be found in your website''s root folder. For general websites, you can view this file using applications like cPanel or FTP client. But if you''re website is based on WordPress, you can view the file using the root of your WordPress installer.</p>\r\n<p>In case you''re not sure whether your site has a robots.txt file or not, you can easily find out by typing your website into the address bar, followed by "robots.txt". It would look something like this:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>www.genericwebsite.com/robots.txt </em></span></p>\r\n<p>If nothing comes up using this URL, you''ll know that your website is running without any robot.txt file. In this case, all you need to do is create a simple text file, using Notepad, and save it as robots.txt. Once this is done, just upload the file to the root folder of your website, using either cPanel or FTP client.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 2: Understanding the Rules of a Robots.txt File</h3>\r\n<p>Once you''ve learnt how to use the file to allow or disallow search engines from detecting and indexing your site, you''re going to need to understand that you''ll have to follow a set format in order to achieve your specific search engine optimization goals.</p>\r\n<p>Here''s a simple example; you own a website called genericwebsite.com, which contains a sub-folder. Now say that this folder contains sensitive or private data, including but not limited to redundant data, testing information or other details that you want to keep hidden. Let''s call the folder <em>testing, </em>assuming you created the folder for testing purposes. Now, your robots.txt should look something like this:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>User-agent: * </em></span><br /><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> <em>Disallow: /testing/ </em></span></p>\r\n<p>Seems simple? It kind of is, but just remember that just because you''ve prevented a website or certain web page from being crawled by search bots, it doesn''t necessarily mean that it won''t show up in the index of various search engines. This is especially true if the site was being crawled earlier, and its pages were allowed to be indexed. It''s up to you to make sure that this doesn''t happen, and the best way to do so is to integrate a disallow rule with "no index" Meta tags. And if the website or the pages you want to keep hidden are still being displayed within the search engine''s index, you''ll have to remove them manually using webmaster tools of the concerned search engines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Also remember that: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Asterisks (*) are typically used as a wildcard.</li>\r\n<li>Use the "allow" directive to make your site accessible to crawling.</li>\r\n<li>Use the "allow" directive to disable crawling.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 3: Learn to use your robots.txt</h3>\r\n<p>Once you''ve created your robots.txt file or identified a pre-existing one, you''re going to have to learn how to use the file to your advantage. As a thumb rile, the first line in of code in your file should name a user agent, which is the name given to a search engine. There are a number of user agents that you can use, including Bingbot &amp; Googlebot. You could restrict the kind of user agent that crawls your site, but it''s recommended to allow all of them, especially if you''re looking to increase traffic to your website.</p>\r\n<p>To instruct all bots to index your site simply write:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>User-agent: * </em></span></p>\r\n<p>Once you''ve inputted that text in your robots.txt file, you''ll have to end the sequence with the allow or disallow commands, depending whether you want the search engine bots to know which part of your site you want them to index or not. It would look something like this:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>User-agent: * </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Allow: /wp-content/uploads/ </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Disallow: /wp-content/plugins/ </em></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Blocking Page</strong></p>\r\n<p>Alternately, you could block search engines from a certain domain or part of it by using:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Robots.txt </strong> - This instructs the user agent to avoid crawling the specified website. Despite this, the robots might retain the site or webpage within the index, displaying it as a result.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Meta NoIndex </strong> - This instructs the user agent that access, but banned from displaying the specified URL in the results. This is the most recommended technique.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nofollowing Links </strong> &ndash; This is the most unsuccessful method of blocking user agents from accessing certain domains as it still allows search engines to mark webpages using other means. These include analytics, using browser tool, or even links from other webpages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 4: Optimize your Robots.txt</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Top to Bottom &ndash; </strong>One of the most common misconceptions of robots.txt files is regarding the method in which a search engine interprets it. Generally, when search engines crawl and index websites, they read the robots.txt file from the top to the bottom. What this means that the search engine crawler will ignore any instructions after any syntax errors or other issues. In such a case, the best way to maintain the integrity of your robots.txt, especially if you''re not sure about your syntax or attempting to try something new or unique, is to type in your syntax at the bottom of your file so that the other directives won''t be ignored even if you do have errors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Make proper use of Wildcards - </strong>The wildcard directive in search engine optimization is a very useful tool as it allows you to create simple text commands that will enable you create disallow patterns found in URLs. But wildcard should be used as such, and not at every possible junction, because if you misconfigure them, you''ll end up mess up the entire code of your website. Another important point to remember is that not all search engine crawlers offer wildcard support, which can put you in quite the fix if you don''t know exactly what you''re doing. Put all and any wildcard texts at the bottom of your file so that you don''t create errors and confuse the search engine bot, who will end up ignoring any other directives.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disallow &ndash; </strong>This is robots.txt optimization 101 for advanced level users, but not so obvious to others. It is important to realize that a robots.txt file can only be used to lock or prevent crawlers from indexing particular sites or web pages, and not to guide them towards URLs that need to be indexed, which would be totally counter-productive. Take special care of this because webmasters often make the mistake of allowing directives that typically do not exist, causing massive errors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Line Breaking &ndash; </strong>Your typical search engine crawlers might read an entire robots.txt file, but it does so in parts. You will first define the user agent, and then input a block of code that that contains all the Disallow directives associated with that specific user agent. The best way to ensure that you don''t mess it up is to leave blank lines between every disallow statement that you wish to incorporate. And if you have to define a fresh user agent, you should do so by placing a blank line that will effectively separate the final disallow statement before defining the new user agent. If you don''t make proper use of line breaks, you will run the risk of creating errors that can cause your other directives to be ignored.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Useful Tips: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Go through the entire library of directories on your website, as there will always be some that you will want to disallow a search engine from indexing. This can include your /scripts/, /cgi-bin/, /cart/, and /wp-admin/ directories, as well as any other directory that contains sensitive data.</li>\r\n<li>It is recommended that you prevent search engines from indexing particular directories within your website. Those that contain duplicate content would be a good start because allowing search engines to index more than one version of your content will negatively affect your SEO ranking.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure that you have nothing preventing the user agent from crawling and indexing the web content that you want others to have access to.</li>\r\n<li>Keep an eye out for specific site files for which you would want to implement the disallow directive. This includes certain files, data or scripts contain personal information like phone numbers, email or physical addresses, and so on.</li>\r\n<li>Avoid using robots.txt files to hide inferior content, prevent indexing of certain categories or dates because it doesn''t really stop the user agent from crawling your website. Instead, make use of web builder specific plugins when adding "noindex" and/or "nofollow" Meta tags. For example, Yoast''s WordPress SEO Plugin.</li>\r\n<li>The <em>disallow readme.html </em> file can be accessed by almost anyone, allowing them to hack into your website. Disallowing it keeps you safe against such hacks. To do this, just type this in the specific robots.txt file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Disallow: /readme.html </em></span></p>\r\n<p>Additionally, disallow any plugin directories, like WordPress plugin directory, as it adds a layer of security to your newly optimized website. To do this, just type:</p>\r\n<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Disallow: /wp-content/plugins/ </em></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Although not meant to affect the privacy of your content, but your website''s XML sitemap to the robots.txt file will result in more efficient indexing of your site.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Step 5: Validation</h3>\r\n<p>The final step in implementing your robots.txt optimization plan is to ensure that your file is free of errors and will perform as desired. By scrutinizing your site''s robots.txt file, you will also prevent your site from having to face any search engine ranking issues. You can employ the use of various validation tools that will not just identify any errors, but will also display all the pages that you have specified to be disallowed.</p>', '', '', '', 0, 'The robots exclusion protocol, aka robots.txt file is a simple text file created by webmasters in order to provide instructions to search engine robots on how they should crawl and index a website and its web pages.', 'robots.txt, Meta Noindex, sitemap', 'how-to-optimize-robots-txt-for-better-seo', 346, '2016-03-01 00:54:00', 0, 1);
